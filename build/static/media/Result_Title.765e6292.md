# Fetch Result

EpiClockR is runing all samples one by one, based on first come first serve rule. So if you just uploade your IDAT file, maybe they have not been analysied. However, you can still press button on the right to check results.

 - We process sample one by one.
 - We don't know any pheno data information, thus we can not do batch correction.
 - Some algorithms are not implemented by us.
