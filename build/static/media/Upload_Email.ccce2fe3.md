# Step 1. Create Stamp Information

Here we need to create a stamp combined with your email and time, like: 

<span style="color:#F30A49">
```
XXX@gmail.com___Code___EPIC___2019-11-16_22:30:15
``` 
</span>

The right are very little information we will need:

 - **You Email**: We will send you an email when we successfully received your data, and another email when your data is finished running.

 - **Data Code**: This code is just in case anybody know your email might fetch your result After analysis, you can use Email and Code togather to fetch result. Code could be anything, your hometown, cat name, fav singer .eg.

 - **Data Type**: Currently, we only support EPIC/450K two types of IDAT file for EpiClockR analysis. Thus, please indicate what is your data type.

After submitting these information, a time stamp would be generated. Then you can click next to upload file.

### Why we need a time stamp?

EpiClockR is a totally free and non-commercial platform. We have no interest to collect
our user's private information, or send you emails.

However, the whole EpiClockR platform is running on a small server, but serving whole world users. Thus,
 I have to created a queuing system behind, to run data one by one. For each time users upload their data,
 we need little information to know who they is, so that you can come back and collect your data in the future.
