### <b>DNA Methylation</b>

<p style="font-size: 14px">
DNA Methylation has been shown to have an important role in normal human development, particularly in
gene expression, cell differentiation, gene imprinting, etc. By extracting and analysing DNA methylation,
researchers can better understand underlying causes behind aging, cancer, and various other diseases.
Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) are commonly used for exploring the difference between
cohorts. Further to this, emerging algorithms and methods allow researchers to use DNA methylation data to
predict numerous common phenotypes.

### <b>Mechine Learning in DNA Methylation</b>

<p style="font-size: 14px">
For instance, DNA methylation data has been shown to demonstrate a clear difference between gender; and
this has long been used in quality control stage. Moreover, due to the presence of thousands of differential
methylated CpGs discovered between healthy age groups, the “Epigenetic Clock” concept was raised, where
DNA methylation data is used to predict sample’s or even organ’s “age”. However, compared with
“chronological age”, the “biological age” produced by the predictor is more likely to represent a level of decline
for a person or organs. This has led to the “Epigenetic Clock” being tightly linked to health. Besides aging,
multiple predictors have been developed, like smoking, tumour, diseases, etc. All these prediction models help
bring epigenetic research into the era of personalized medicine.

### <b>Why we create EpiClockR?</b>

<p style="font-size: 14px">
Currently, despite numerous epigenetic prediction tools being developed, they remain difficult to use and there
is no online platform to run any of the predictors effectively. This has been hampered by tedious pre-processing,
various coding language and computing requirements.

Here we present EpiclockR, a freely-available, online platform that implements a comprehensive and
systematic pipeline of all major epigenetic clocks and other common predictors (e.g. smoking predictor).
After uploading their own data files, Users can easily, and instantly view and compare different the results
produced from multiple epigenetic predictors.
